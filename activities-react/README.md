# Activities React App
This app was built using react and offers an web interface
to explore cycling workout activities. These activities are pulled
from a REST API that is exposed by the `activities-service` microservice
(more details [here](../activities-service/README.md)).

## Usage
This react app is built using `create-react-app`, hence can
be started using `npm start` (after having installed dependencies
using `npm install`).
